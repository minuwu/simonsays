This project is a browser-based Simon Says memory game. The game generates a sequence of flashing colored buttons with sounds, and the player must repeat the sequence by clicking in the correct order. Each round increases the sequence length, testing memory and attention. The game features a dynamic score system, persistent high score tracking using localStorage, a reset button, sound effects for feedback, and animated visual states for pressed and wrong inputs. The layout is responsive, including a side info card explaining the rules, and adapts well to smaller screens for mobile play.
